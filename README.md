# The Psychic Game

Check it out: [The Psychic Game](https://hoomanfor.github.io/psychic-game/)

In this exercise, I have built a game using Vanilla Javascript. Once the game starts, the app will randomly select an alphabet from A to Z. Your goal is to guess this random alphabet. Per game, you have 9 guesses to win or lose. Good Luck! :-D
